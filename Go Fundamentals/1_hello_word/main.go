//Directly machine code executalble ha //Go is a compiled language, which means that the source code is translated into machine code that can be executed directly by the computer's processor. When you run a Go program, the Go compiler takes the source code and compiles it into an executable binary file. This binary file contains the machine code instructions that the computer can execute directly,
//  without the need for an interpreter or virtual machine. This allows Go programs to run efficiently and with high performance.
