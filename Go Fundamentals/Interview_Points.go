// Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by Google,
// designed for simplicity, performance, and efficient concurrent programming.

// ## ✅ What is Go (Golang)?

// **Go (Golang)** is an **open-source, statically typed, compiled programming language** developed by **Google in 2009**.

// It was designed to be:

// * ✅ Simple
// * ✅ Fast
// * ✅ Efficient
// * ✅ Built for concurrency

// ---

// ## 🔹 Why Go was created?

// Google created Go to:

// * Handle **large-scale systems**
// * Improve **performance over interpreted languages**
// * Simplify complex languages like C++
// * Support **concurrent programming easily**

// ---

// ## 🔹 Key Features

// * ⚡ **Compiled language** (fast execution)
// * 🧠 **Simple syntax**
// * 🔁 **Built-in concurrency (Goroutines & Channels)**
// * 📦 **Strong standard library**
// * 🚀 Used for cloud & backend systems

// ---

// ## 🔹 Where Go is Used?

// * Backend APIs
// * Microservices
// * Cloud systems
// * DevOps tools
// * Kubernetes (written in Go)
// * Docker (written in Go)

// If you want, I can also give:

// * 🔹 Go vs Java comparison
// * 🔹 Why companies prefer Go
// * 🔹 When to use Go in real projects

// Use Go When:

// Building scalable backend APIs

// Creating microservices

// Handling high concurrent users

// Working with cloud infrastructure

// Building DevOps tools

// ❌ Not Ideal When:

// Building heavy enterprise apps (Java/Spring strong here)

// Complex OOP-heavy systems

// Android development

// 🎯 30-Second Interview Answer

// “Go is preferred for high-performance, scalable backend systems because of its simplicity and lightweight concurrency model using goroutines. It’s widely used in cloud-native applications, microservices, and infrastructure tools like Kubernetes and Docker.”

// Since you’re a React + Node developer, learning Go can help you move toward:

// Backend specialization

// High-performance APIs

// DevOps / Cloud roles

// Better SDE opportunities

// If you want, I can suggest a strong Go project idea that boosts your resume.
